author: johnoduinn
service_about: Many agencies need to train their teams and managers in practical remote / telework skills in the event of prolonged government office closures or scaling telework opportunities to build a more resilient and modern workforce. Developing specialized in-house training programs like this is time consuming, and requires in-depth knowledge of industry best practices as well as agency-specific needs. We consult with executives, stakeholders, and in-house trainers to help them develop training materials and online delivery methods to meet their agencyâ€™s specific needs. These customized telework training programs help improve team performance and coordination whether your team is already physically distributed, or transitioning out from an office.
cost: Varies according to complexity of engagement and agency needs. To speed up this complex, custom process, we use common patterns and established best practices wherever applicable.
