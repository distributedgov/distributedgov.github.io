As civic leaders wrestle with and seriously address the issues of our times — disasters, pandemics, climate change, health and wellness, economic empowerment — distributed government teams are now a necessity to delivering responsive and resilient public services.

Launched to help public service teams build and scale highly effective remote and telework environments, [DistributedGov](https://distributedgov.com/) ([https://distributedgov.com])(https://distributedgov.com) takes a broad approach to addressing these challenges.

DistributedGov is a full-scale platform of [services](/services), [resources](/guide) and [community](/community) to support public service leaders and team members as remote/telework becomes a standard way for how government operates.

DistributedGov provides a topic-based filter so that public service teams can easily find immediately practical remote/telework services and resources:

Initial topics addressed include [Zoom for government](/help/zoom-for-government), [Zoom and security](/help/zoom-security-zoom-bombing), and the [new semantics](/help/why-are-they-called-distributed-teams) around the terms “distributed,” “telework” and “remote.”

## Webinar
On June 24, DistributedGov will host a free, one-hour webinar, ‘[Distributed Government 101: Introduction to Effective Telework in Government](/training/introduction-to-effective-telework-in-government),’ presented by John O’Duinn, author of “[Distributed Teams: The Art and Practice of Working Together While Physically Apart](https://www.amzn.com/1732254907).”

DistributedGov is powered by [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/), a 100-person digital government services firm that has operated in a fully distributed work environment with no office since its inception, for more than 15 years.
