    "question" : "What is Zoom bombing?",
    "answer"  : "Given all the newly-working-from-home zoom users out there, and the recent flurry of security alerts for Zoom video conference software, I thought this summary would be helpful.\n\n(1) A few zero-day security exploits for zoom were announced recently. Many are already fixed in the latest version of zoom. And watch carefully for new updates from zoom in the coming days. As expected, soon after writing this post, zoom released a updated version with security fixes. Make sure you are running at least v4.6.10 (20041.0408).\n\n(2) “zoom bombing” happens when someone guesses your meeting url, joins un-invited and disrupts your meeting. To prevent this, there is an existing setting in zoom to add a password to your meetings. Use it. To make this easy for users, zoom appends the password to the meeting URL, so most people using zoom just click on the URL and join instantly without needing to type in the password. Importantly, people without the URL cannot zoombomb your meeting unless they guess the meetingID and the long password! To review your settings (and if needed change this setting), login to your zoom profile on zoom.us and look at your user profile settings. Under “Personal -&gt; Settings -&gt; Meeting”, make sure you have at least these three settings turned on.\n\n\n\n(3) Zoom changed the default settings on Sunday (05apr2020), to address press coverage around zoom-bombings, and push users to use these passwords by default. Watch for changes to default zoom meeting behavior Monday morning – depending on your existing meeting invites, you may have to re-notify attendees of new longer-URL-with-password for upcoming meetings. NOTE: I recommend putting the zoom URL into your calendar invite, so all attendees see the same info at the same time. This helps you avoid delaying meetings while people search for the correct/updated URL and end up joining the meeting late. Zoom also wrote their own “tips and tricks for secure zoom meetings” post which you might also find helpful to read.\n\n(4) The Washington Post reported that a bunch of Zoom “cloud” recordings were found on publicly-accessible Amazon S3 buckets. Details still developing, but until this is clarified, I recommend checking your zoom meeting invites for any meetings you record and change them from “cloud” to “local recordings”.\n\nThats all for now. If you know of any other zoom essential tips I should share, please let me know.\n"

    "title"    : "Transitioning From Offices to Distributed Teams During a Crisis",
    "url"      : "/help/transitioning-from-offices-to-distributed-teams-during-a-crisis",
    "question" : "What are some things to keep in mind when transitioning my team to remote / telework?",
    "answer"  : "One of the hidden costs of a company or agency office is office closures. If an organization requires people to be physically together to work, then anytime those humans cannot be in the office disrupts day-to-day operations. The physical office has become an expensive single point of failure for the entire organization. Brief office closures can usually be recovered from quickly – by having staff work late afterwards to catchup before clients notice the disruption. Prolonged office closures or transit disruptions are expensive per-day, can quickly become hard to recover from and even become company-threatening. In scenarios like this, how to change the culture from “office as single-point-of-failure” to “office optional”?\n\nHaving humans able to work well together, even while physically apart, is an essential skill that has to be learned and practiced regularly. The trick for office-based organizations is how to have humans learn this new skill without causing disruption during this transition.\n\nHere are some immediate steps you can take to help keep your office-based organization running smoothly when an office closure is suddenly required.\n\n\n  \n    Keep in mind that changing an existing all-in-one-location team into a distributed team is tricky. After all, human culture change is tricky. Avoid making big announcements that encourage unreasonable expectations, raise concerns about “yet another management fad” and quickly doom your initiative with cynicism. In times of crisis, avoid adding a sense of panic by surprising people with major unplanned changes. Instead, quietly start improving how work is organized, in ways that are helpful to everyone in your current office culture and also allow humans to start working as part of a distributed team.\n  \n  \n    If you already have any employees who already work from home on a periodic basis, meet them all on a video call. Do this today after you finish reading this post. They will have real-world, concrete advice, immediately specific to your organization. Ask them to describe specific problems they know impede them from working well from their homes, listen carefully, take notes and probe for suggestions if none are obviously forthcoming. Fixing their list of known issues should now be at the top of your todo list. Ask them to keep you posted if other issues arise. Also ask if they would be willing, as role models, to help coach and mentor others transitioning from office-only work to work-from-home work. If you don’t already have anyone working from home, then you need to find a handful of early volunteers willing to try a one-day experiment, starting today. Include at least one C-level executive, who will be the high-level champion to quickly unblock any roadblocks or purchase approvals needed.\n  \n  \n    Ask this group of volunteers to work from home the very next day for one day only. Importantly, they should do this using only what equipment they routinely carry home with them in their typical bag when leaving the office. Note: I have found it important to only do this “work from home” experimental day on a Tues/Wed/Thurs. Avoid doing this experiment on a Mon/Fri, as it is too easy for others to cynically view the experiment as an invitation for a long weekend instead of a normal working day.\n  \n  \n    For this one day experiment, it is important that this group do the work they had normally scheduled to do in the office, but instead do that same work from their home. This is not about doing solo headsdown work at home. This is about doing their normal “office work” collaborating with coworkers, while each human is in a different non-office location. Specifically, I am not talking about everyone being at home, each doing solo headsdown work. I’m specifically talking about doing your normal meetings, co-editing documents with coworkers in other locations, negotiating planning meetings, taking calls with clients… everything you would do in a normal day at your office location – but from home instead. Start the “work from home” experimental day with a quick group video call to make sure everyone is still aware of the experiment. At the end of the day, meet for another quick group video call to discuss what problems were discovered during the day, and decide what can be fixed quickly before the next “work from home” day experiment. Worst case, if things go horribly wrong, some will struggle through their day, and have a busy catchup day after, but you have now learned valuable information on what practical things to fix quickly before possible office closures.\n  \n  \n    Start by making sure that you and your immediate team are crisply organized, using audio-video calls for all meetings, with everyone on their own head-and-shoulders camera, using shared meeting agendas, shared meeting note-taking, and so on – each of the chapters in the “How” section of my book. These baby steps are low risk, low cost, and they improve day-to-day work life for everyone, so good to do anyway. Just as importantly, each improvement helps build trust that future changes will also improve work life for everyone in or out of the office. As these initial improvements become the new normal for the team culture, start introducing other higher level improvements from the rest of my book. Keep relentless focus on quiet, gradual improvements. Keep taking baby steps. They might not seem to be helping at first, but I have achieved everything I’ve described in my book across decades of experience working in several different organizations through persistent, stubborn, relentless baby steps.\n  \n  \n    Knowing how to use the tools is important. Just as important is knowing how to lead and manage teams while physically apart. For companies with offices, employees asking to work from home are often viewed as asking for an unnecessary perk that somehow reduces operational efficiency. Supervisors who typically manage by walking around the corridors (the “butts in seats” approach) don’t know how to supervise humans not in the office. A frequent concern is “how will I know people are doing work”, to which I usually ask “how do you currently know people in the office are doing work?” This is usually a good time to remind people that in the United States, every year we celebrate a day where people come to the office to shop online – Cyber Monday is so important, it shifts the stock market. It’s worth noting that this mindset also ignores a larger continuity of business problem. If you usually work from an office, managing by walking around, then the physical office has become essential to the manager’s daily operational work. Changing how you manage can be hard. Being able to lead and manage people equally well, in the office and/or at home, is exactly why I wrote this tactical hands-on management book. In addition, leading distributed teams during a crisis assumes you do all this perfectly and also give frequent, timely, truthful updates on what is happening. Anything less than this will enable rumors, erode trust in leadership and cause even more operational disruption.\n  \n  \n    As these volunteers become routinely successful, start expanding from one-day-a-week to two-non-adjacent-days-a-week, and if there are no problems, keep gradually increasing the cadence. As this group of initial volunteers become more accustomed to their new work arrangements, gradually start adding other volunteers who will be mentored by the initial group of volunteers. Keep doing regular debriefs, learning/adjusting the tooling and systems as new paper-cut issues are discovered and then fixed. Having the entire organization suddenly switch to working from home risks discovering some all remote-access system that had not been load tested, disrupting everyone at the same time. This process of scaling up group size and cadence helps quickly discover any load bottlenecks early and with disruption to the fewest possible humans.\n  \n\n\nWhen your physical office is no longer an organizational single point of failure, it reduces risk. This helps everyone at the company be more confident about their work and job security during this crisis. Even if there is organizational risk because of wider market disruption, at least the part each human has control over – doing their own work – is something they can still do to the best of their ability. This is obviously important for the organization to survive the current crisis with minimal disruption. This is also important for the humans, helping reduce feelings of helplessness and fostering a new-found confidence that the team can work through future unknown crises as well. Work is an important factor in people’s lives, so stability at work allows people to focus their concerns on caring for themselves and the humans around them.\n\nQuietly, quickly and with very little fuss, the mindset of the organization will shift from “the office is a single point of organizational failure” to “the office is optional”. This is success. After the dust settles on this crisis, these newly learned skills will continue to be important for other future crises. Just as importantly, these office-optional organizations can keep the immediate benefits of hiring faster, hiring better, hiring more diversely and improving retention, while also reducing the recurring overhead of office costs as their existing office leases expire. The secret ingredient in this transition was consistent, thoughtful, humane, and crisply organized leadership.\n\n(Portions of this are from my book “Distributed Teams: The Art and Practice of Working Together While Physically Apart”.)\n"

    "question" : "What is Zoom for Government?",
    "answer"  : "Many agencies have been using Zoom for video conferencing since the office closures related to coronavirus began. Many distributed teams in the private sector were already avid users of the software – but concerns about security and privacy have left some government agencies hesitant.\n\nZoom offers a government-oriented version of its services, described thus: “Zoom’s secure video communications solution is easy to deploy, manage, and scale. With consistent and reliable high-quality video, even in low-bandwidth environments, government departments and agencies can reduce costs, improve efficiency, enhance internal collaboration, and extend citizen services.”\n\n“Zoom for Government” is a paid tier of Zoom that is hosted in a separate cloud and allows a greater range of features and control – thus offering potentially better security through advanced settings. Some agencies (especially those with large-scale meeting needs) may decide this option makes Zoom an acceptable tool to meet security standards.\n\nHowever, even the free version of Zoom can be configured to offer a high level of security – here is Zoom’s guide to help you do that. As with most things in government, the decision to Zoom or not to Zoom will be influenced by a variety of evolving factors and will look different from one agency to another. A few things to keep in mind:\n\nSettings matter. Knowing how to configure your meetings makes a huge difference in their security and privacy. Learn how to use settings to your advantage.\n\nGuidance is evolving. Zoom is making continual updates to its platform as more users sign up and demand better security. Official guidance from authorities will be subject to change as agencies learn more about the various platforms. We encourage everyone to educate themselves and contribute to the conversation on empowering government work both remotely and securely.\n\nSecurity needs vary. The volume of official and classified information that most agencies need to exchange via video conferencing is small compared to the everyday business of government teams. Keep this in mind when making policy decisions, and don’t needlessly hamper daily productivity in the name of security.\n\nHere’s a glimpse of the current (and varied) landscape of Zoom in government:\n\nFedRAMP and GSA approved\n\nAccording to FCW, “The Zoom for Government platform is on the General Services Administration’s buying schedule and also has that agency’s Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program moderate level approval. Zoom was sponsored in the FedRAMP approval process by the Department of Homeland Security, according to the company. The authorization allows federal agencies and contractors to securely use Zoom for government video meetings and API integrations, according to the company.”\n\nDOD approved (for unclassified situations)\n\nAccording to Defense One, “Zoom is officially approved for use in unclassified situations by troops, DoD employees, and contractors.”\n\nState Department frowns on free version of Zoom for official business\n\nAccording to VOA, “The State Department sent an email to employees … saying that the free version of Zoom “is not authorized for the conduct of official business or on official Department devices used to access OpenNet.” It told employees to use Cisco Webex, FAN Google Meet, Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business. ”\n\nMore resources\n\n\n  Zoom security overview (Zoom)\n  Setting up secure Zoom meetings for local governments (Michigan State University)\n\n"

    "url"      : "/help/why-are-they-called-distributed-teams",
    "question" : "What’s the difference between “teleworking” and “distributed”?",
    "answer"  : "Many people use terms like ‘remote work,’ ‘telework,’ or ‘distributed team’ interchangeably – because in all cases they are talking about people who perform their jobs from somewhere besides the office building. But the difference is really in the connotation of the words, and how the words affect our perceptions and actions in a team setting, which we will examine in a moment.\n\nTeleworking: blast from the past\n\n“Teleworking” and “telecommuting” are phrases developed several decades ago when the option of working from home had just emerged. Technologies and processes have changed a lot since then, and so has the language used to describe such arrangements – though many institutions still use ‘teleworking’ as the default term for working-outside-of-the-office.\n\nThe main thing to understand is that fully- or partially- distributed teams are much more common now –  whereas in the past it was likely to be just one or a handful of employees working from somewhere besides the office. In those cases, the ‘teleworker’ was an anomaly, and was pretty much left to their own devices in terms of figuring out collaboration and communication with their co-located colleagues.\n\nDistributed teams: building a resilient future\n\nSuccessful, modern ‘distributed teams’ – even those where only some employees are working remotely – adopt the mindset that all team members should be empowered and expected to participate and collaborate equally, regardless of their location. There is a growing abundance of tools and resources (including the Distributed Government Guide) to help teams do this effectively.\n\nJohn O’Duinn, author of Distributed Teams: The Art and Practice of Working Together While Physically Apart, provides a detailed look into the distinctions between remote-work terms, and how subtle differences in words affect our perceptions and assumptions about distributed teams:\n\n\n  All humans on the team work together, even though they are physically apart from each other. This is not a collection of individuals who each do solo heads-down work from different locations. Instead, this is a group of humans who coordinate their work with others on their physically distributed team. Because everyone on the physically distributed team is “remote” from someone, it is clear that everyone on the team has equal responsibility to communicate and coordinate their work with coworkers – regardless of whether any individual human is working from a building with the company logo on the door, from home, from a coworking space, a hotel or a parked car! Example usage: “I work on a distributed team”, “my team is distributed”.\n\n\nGovernment is just one industry that stands to benefit from more flexible and collaborative teams. With small-but-important shifts in the way we think and talk about working in nontraditional arrangements, we can be part of the critical movement toward a more modern and resilient workforce.\n"

Virtual Private Network (VPN), if required, and confirm that your employees can access it from their homes.\n  Run load tests to ensure your VPN and other services can handle a sudden uptick as workers access on-premise and cloud applications from remote locations.\n  For your tech employees, make sure critical services like source control, build pipelines, and dev/test/prod environments are available remotely.\n  Scale and automate tech infrastructure as needed\n\n\nRe-consider roles and responsibilities\n\n\n  Identify which employees need to remain in the office to do tasks that require access to specific on-site equipment.\n  Set up workflows to ensure that employees in the office are not required to handle remote employees’ regular assignments (i.e., answering phone calls to desk phones).\n\n\nEnsure employees have the right equipment\n\n\n  Access to high speed internet at home (or ability to tether from mobile device)\n  Laptop or computer\n  Headset / earbuds and

paperless’\n  Document signing: Docusign or other electronic signature app\n  Virtual faxes: Free online fax services\n\n\nSet measurable expectations\n\n\n  Establish work assignment logs or other tracking tools to provide specific and attainable performance expectations for all employees — those in the office and remote workers.\n  Maintain signed copies of any checklists or agreements (e.g., Employee Safety Checklist, Team Agreement, Telework Assignment Logs, etc.)\n  Remember that you won’t be able to measure and track every detail, nor should you try — instead, adopt processes that

improvement (and find other agencies you can point to as examples)\n\n\nRun experiments before leaving the office\n\n\n  Work from a different desk / room to identify any paper files you may need (then consider whether those files can be digitized).\n  Identify and bookmark key URLs for systems needed in your daily work.\n  Use a cell phone hotspot to test network access, and consider whether you need to make changes to your cell phone data plan.\n  Confirm working phone / e-mail access to your agency’s IT helpdesk.\n\n\nSet up your remote work environment\n\n\n  Dedicate a desk or working space in your home.\n    \n      Background (for video conferencing) should be free of clutter or other people\n      Surrounding noises and distractions should be minimized\n    \n  \n  Consider how

with video calls\n  Schedule a recurring social call — perhaps on Fridays — to strengthen your connections with co-workers\n\n\nSet a daily routine\n\n\n  Get up, dress professionally, make coffee, walk the dog — keeping your usual workday habits will prepare your mind to ‘get to work’.\n  Schedule intentional breaks to get up and move throughout the day for mental and physical health.\n  Set agreed-upon working hours with your team, then stick to them — avoid the temptation to keep working because there is no ‘office’ to leave at the end of the day.\n  If you’re caring for kids or

This will not make your teams fail more, it will empower them to succeed.\n  Encourage “distributed leadership” – rather than trying to micromanage everything, allow natural leaders to emerge and let teams self-organize when they are comfortable doing so.\n\n\nOver-communicate\n\n\n  Make sure policies, plans, and other important documents are easily accessible to teams through a “Single Source of Truth” or central location.\n  Use multiple channels to communicate important information (i.e., email, group chat, video call announcement).\n  Hold virtual “office hours” where anyone can drop by with a question or concern.\n  Schedule regular All Hands calls where you can share updates with the whole team, or invite team members to present on their projects.\n  Establish regular check-ins for project updates or smaller teams:\n    \n      What I did yesterday\n      What I’m working on today\n      Questions / concerns / action items\n    \n  \n\n\nUnderstand everyone’s context\n\n\n  Take some time to learn about various work styles and communication styles and how they will affect each individual’s remote work approach.\n  Be aware of cultural differences that may affect distributed team dynamics (i.e., speaking up to participate in the conversation vs. remaining silent on video calls)\n  During check-ins with direct reports, specifically ask about any concerns they have, and see how you can support them.\n\n\nBuild human connection\n\n\n  Schedule topic-based social video calls to build connection and camaraderie for team members (i.e., favorite movies, funny pet stories, family traditions).\n  Develop remote rituals for celebrating with the team and acknowledging contributions.\n  Create virtual spaces for “water cooler” and non-work interactions (i.e., group chat channels focused on music, gardening, or other commonly shared interests).\n  Encourage everyone to take a few minutes at the beginning of virtual meetings to acknowledge “humanness” by asking about the other person’s day, weekend plans, or other topics of general interest.\n\n\nResources\n\nGuidance\n\n\n  Telework Manager FAQs (U.S. Office of Personnel Management)\n\n\nPosts\n\n\n  The manager’s manual for remote work (Slack)\n  Remotely Managing (Stella Garber on Medium)\n  How to build a remote team (GitLab)\n  How to lead a distributed team (Range)\n  A guide to managing your (newly) remote workers (Harvard Business Review)\n  Managing distributed project teams (Project Management Institute)\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n  Remote Work How To: Tips For Managing A Remote Team\n  The 21 Rules for Managing Remote Teams\n\n"

If you can’t attend a specific instance of a recurring meeting, decline for that specific instance.\n  If you need to cancel a meeting, delete the calendar event and notify all guests (most platforms have this as a feature).\n  Make calendar invitations editable by all guests to decentralize meeting logistics.\n  Differentiate between invitees who need to be at the meeting and those whose attendance is optional.\n\n\nPrepare ahead of time\n\n\n  Prepare an agenda in an editable document and share with people who will attend.\n    \n      Key talking points and how long you plan to spend on each one\n      Members that will be in attendance\n      What each person is responsible for contributing to the meeting\n      Relevant files, links, research, etc.\n      Action items will be added during the meeting\n    \n  \n  Add the shared meeting agenda document (and other relevant materials) in the calendar link so everyone can access it in advance.\n  Provide a dial-in option for guests who won’t be able to use video.\n\n\nStay on task\n\n\n  Take shared notes during the meeting – everyone adds their own notes and action items to ensure accuracy and equal distribution of note-taking responsibility.\n  Adhere to the predetermined agenda or structure for the meeting, and sidebar other conversations for another time.\n  Make sure every person knows their role and responsibility for the meeting. If they don’t have one, they may not need to attend.\n  Before ending the meeting, make sure everyone knows:\n    \n      Action items and who will do them\n      When deliverables are due\n      Logistics for the next meeting\n    \n  \n\n\nUse meeting tools effectively\n\n\n  Default to keeping your video on during meetings, if at all possible. Meetings are faster and more productive when people can use non-verbal cues.\n  If you’re having trouble hearing someone in a meeting, stop them using visual cues (e.g., raise your hand or point to your ear). Don’t wait until they finish talking.\n  Mute when you are not speaking.\n  Use the meeting chat feature to add supporting comments or side questions.\n  If you have connectivity issues during the meeting, try:\n    \n      Adjusting video quality settings (example from Google Meet)\n      Turning off video\n      Dialing in\n    \n  \n\n\nShow respect to others\n\n\n  Show up on time and end on time.\n  Start with introductions if some guests don’t know others.\n  Refer to the shared agenda document to make sure everyone’s items are addressed.\n  Don’t stare at your phone or be obviously distracted while others are presenting.\n  To make sure quiet people get heard, “pass” the conversation in a way that allows everyone time to speak.\n\n\nMake space to be human\n\n\n  Schedule meetings with a little time to spare at the end (e.g., 25 instead of 30 min) to allow people to transition or take small breaks.\n  Encourage some small talk at the beginning of the meeting to foster connection among distributed team members.\n  Normalize human activities that must sometimes happen during remote calls (i.e., eating, getting a package delivery, dealing with interruptions by children). People should feel comfortable to do these things while on mute.\n\n\nAvoid having too many meetings\n\n\n  Document work and status updates in a central location so anyone can review asynchronously without the need for a meeting.\n  Block time in your schedule for “focused work” as a calendar event – preventing others from scheduling meetings on top of it.\n  Cancel recurring meetings when they are no longer productive or necessary.\n  Do not schedule meetings for status updates or quick questions – first, see if you can find out by pinging someone in chat or checking the Single Source of Truth.\n  Do schedule structured meetings for specific, predetermined purposes.\n\n\nTools\n\nVideo calls\n\n\n  Zoom\n  Jitsi\n  Google Meet\n  Slack calls\n  Microsoft Teams\n\n\nScheduling\n\n\n  Google Calendar\n  Calendly\n\n\nResources\n\n\n  Meetings and meeting tools (18F)\n  Scheduling Meetings (GitLab)\n  New and changing patterns for digital working (Ben Holliday)\n  All-Remote Meetings (GitLab)\n  Tips for video conferencing (CISA)\n\n"

Don’t wait until something is “done” to find out if it’s the right thing.\n  Iterate on feedback that is given, and repeat the cycle to build trust with collaborators.\n  Use tools that allow for simultaneous and asynchronous collaboration.\n  Invite ideas from everywhere – team members, stakeholders, and customers should all be able to “submit a bug” or “suggest a feature”.\n\n\nKeep the work visible\n\n\n  Share product roadmaps and team plans as openly as possible, so people can refer to them at any time to get aligned.\n  Document everything in a “Single Source of Truth” that contains all the information, deadlines, reports, and links for the project so knowledge is shared.\n  Use project tracking software that allows the team to follow along as tasks are completed (this is helpful for any kind of project, not just software development.)\n  For software projects, keep the documentation close to the code (or written into it).\n\n\nHave the whole team ‘act’ distributed\n\n\n  If you have some employees in the office and some remote, have everyone use the same online project management tools so people stay aligned.\n  Have all team members use video conferencing for meetings, not just the teleworkers.\n  Have everyone add their working hours, availability, and timezones to their calendars and group chat profiles.\n  Set team agreements for response times for different channels (i.e., group chat, email, project tickets) so people know when a quick answer is expected, and when it’s not.\n\n\nFoster human connection and accountability\n\n\n  Celebrate project “wins” by hosting virtual happy hours or pizza parties.\n  Write appreciation into your project management practices (e.g., start retrospectives by acknowledging each team member’s contributions).\n  Make it a rule to assume best intentions, as virtual communications can be more easily misinterpreted than face-to-face talks.\n  Let your team know that mistakes happen, and openly acknowledging them is encouraged.\n\n\nBe a servant leader\n\n\n  Instead of asking when something will be done, ask if there are blockers you can help clear.\n  Set expectations and give teams the tools to track and submit their work openly.\n  Choose trust over surveillance – allow people the space and flexibility to get their work done on their own terms, within agreed-upon timelines.\n  Encourage question asking. Clarity is exponentially more important in distributed teams.\n  Set up “office hours” where anyone can drop by with a question or to brainstorm solutions.\n  Assign a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for each part of the project, so everyone knows who is responsible for what.\n\n\nKeep lines of communication open\n\n\n  Hold daily check-ins with project teams to quickly get the latest information:\n    \n      What I worked on yesterday\n      What I’m working on today\n      Questions / blockers / action items\n    \n  \n  Have the team put questions and updates in group channels so knowledge is shared.\n  Maintain a “risk register” where anyone can view potential risks throughout the project.\n  Set standards and “rules of engagement” for dealing with tensions and conflict.\n\n\nReflect and improve\n\n\n  Use retrospectives to reflect as a group on how a project or process could be improved.\n    \n      What do we appreciate about each member of the group?\n      What is going well?\n      What could be better?\n      Action items for moving forward\n    \n  \n  Run “tool-checks” by asking team members for feedback on the tools you are using for remote collaboration.\n    \n      How is this tool working well?\n      Are there any pain points?\n    \n  \n  Document all reflections and action items in a shared space where everyone can refer back to them.\n  Don’t be discouraged by problems that arise from managing projects in distributed teams – write down your learnings and make adjustments as necessary.\n\n\nTools\n\n\n  GitHub\n  GitLab\n  Trello\n  Jira\n  Basecamp\n  Asana\n  Monday.com\n  ToDoist\n\n\nResources\n\nPosts\n\n\n  Remote Projects 101: The Remote Guide to Project Management (Twist)\n  This Is How We Manage Projects on a Fully Remote Team (Doist)\n  How to successfully project manage distributed teams (Corrus)\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n  Managing Remote Teams Successfully: Remote Project Management Tips &amp; Tactics\n\n"

    "content"  : "As civic leaders wrestle with and seriously address the issues of our times — disasters, pandemics, climate change, health and wellness, economic empowerment — distributed teams is the obvious solution for delivering responsive and resilient government services.\n\nDefining distributed\n\nJohn O’Duinn, author of Distributed Teams: The Art and Practice of Working Together While Physically Apart, has written the definitive book on why distributed teams are important, and how they can be even more effective than their collocated counterparts.\n\nO’Duinn makes clear distinctions between ‘distributed teams,’ ‘virtual teams,’ ‘virtual employee,’ ‘remote work,’ ‘remote employee,’ ‘work from home,’ ‘work from anywhere’ and ‘telework’. The subtle differences in these terms affect our perceptions and assumptions about distributed teams.\n\nHow he describes ‘distributed’:\n\n\n  All humans on the team work together, even though they are physically apart from each other. This is not a collection of individuals who each do solo heads-down work from different locations. Instead, this is a group of humans who coordinate their work with others on their physically distributed team. Because everyone on the physically distributed team is “remote” from someone, it is clear that everyone on the team has equal responsibility to communicate and coordinate their work with coworkers – regardless of whether any individual human is working from a building with the company logo on the door, from home, from a coworking space, a hotel or a parked car! Example usage: “I work on a distributed team”, “my team is distributed”.\n\n\nWhy distributed is important\n\nKey reasons why distributed teams are critical, especially for government:\n\n\n  Representation: Geographically distributed government workforce more closely matches the needs and concerns of the entire wider population.\n  Resiliency: Ability to maintain operations regardless of whereabouts, especially if physical locations or regions have been compromised for a prolonged period of time.\n  Recruiting: Talent pool is expanded to include people of diverse backgrounds, ages, abilities, and experience.\n  Cost savings: Leasing and maintenance of physical buildings become flexible expenses as agencies shift to partly or fully distributed.\n  Sustainability: Decreased carbon footprint as fewer people are commuting.\n  Work/life balance: Government employees spend less time commuting and invest more energy into their families and communities.\n  Economic empowerment: Financial employment benefits are distributed across multiple local communities rather than centralizing to one.\n\n\nIncreased empathy\n\nIn addition to the above reasons, distributed government teams can tap into a stronger sense of empathy — a value inherent in the role of authentic public service.\n\nOnce you truly experience distributed culture, you have a stronger understanding of what digital services really mean and how they can make or break the end user experience. If public servants don’t place themselves in digital environments of their own, their ability to have complete empathy for those they serve is lessened.\n\nDistributed digital government service teams have more potential to have empathy for their end users. Immersing yourself into a distributed team is the ultimate digital service user research experience.\n\nWe have the means\n\nWe now have low cost, high reliability tools — G Suite, Slack, GitHub, and Zoom to name just a few — that fully empower asynchronous, instant collaboration. Training on the tools is of course important. Just as important is the training on how to work in and lead distributed teams, fostering a culture of distributed work, and implementing policies to support highly effective distributed teams.\n\nGovernment is doing this\n\n18F has actively socialized the benefits of distributed teams and how this model has made its teams more effective. Some documentation on their recommended best practices:\n\n\n  18F’s best practices for making distributed teams work\n  Leading dynamic and distributed teams\n  Making a distributed design team work\n  3 ways to manage research projects remotely\n\n\nVendors are doing this\n\nMany government contractors and vendors are fully distributed. CivicActions is an 80-person government digital services firm serving federal, state and local governments throughout the United States. There are many others — particularly newer, more innovative government and civic technology vendors — operating in the same way. Being able to work in physically distributed teams allows government agencies to work with the best vendor for that project, not just the best nearby vendor.\n\nSurvey says\n\nA 2019 Owl Labs survey highlights the varying benefits of the distributed model. Here are just a few:\n\n\n  Remote workers earn salaries higher than $100,000/year, 2.2x more frequently than on-site workers.\n  Remote workers say they’re happy in their jobs 29% more than on-site workers — 71% of remote workers say they’re happy in their job, and only 55% of on-site workers say they’re happy in their job.\n  34% of U.S. workers would take a pay cut of up to 5% in order to work remotely.\n  42% of remote workers plan to work remotely more frequently than they currently do in the next 5 years, and that more than half of on-site workers want to start working remotely.\n  55% of remote workers would be likely to look for another job if they were no longer allowed to work remotely. And 61% of remote workers would expect a pay increase if they were no longer allowed to work remotely.\n  68% of remote workers say they are not concerned working remotely will impact their career progression, while 23% say they fear it would.\n  The top reasons remote workers choose to work remotely include: better work-life balance (91%), increased productivity/better focus (79%), less stress (78%) and avoiding a commute (78%).\n  Remote workers say they work more than 40 hours per week 43% more than on-site workers do. However, on-site workers are also working longer weeks because it’s required of them, while more remote workers are doing so because they enjoy what they do.\n\n\nDistributed government\n\nFor government to authentically deliver meaningful public services of the future, it will need to embrace the inevitable relevance and importance of distributed teams.\n\nIf government leaders truly value representation, resiliency, sustainability, work/life balance, hiring the best and brightest, economic empowerment, instilling exponential passion for mission-driven work and the many other possibilities for civic innovation, embracing the distributed mindset is the new requisite of how we will define the next phase of public service.\n"
